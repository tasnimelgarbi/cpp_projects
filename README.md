# Name Drawing (Graphics Project)

This branch contains a C++ graphics project that displays the name "Tasnim" using graphical drawing functions.

## Description:
- The project uses the `graphics.h` library to render the name as a visual design on the screen.
- Each letter of the name is drawn manually using lines, curves, or shapes to create a custom artistic look.

## Requirements:
- Code::Blocks or any IDE that supports `graphics.h`.
- Proper setup of the graphics library on Windows (e.g., including `winbgim` or equivalent).

## Files:
- `main.cpp`: The main source file that initializes the graphics window and draws the name.

## Notes:
- Make sure to run the code in an environment where `graphics.h` is correctly configured.
- You can modify the code to draw other names or enhance the design with colors and animation effects.

## Example Output:
> A colorful or structured rendering of "Tasnim" displayed graphically (not using text or console).
