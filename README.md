# Chess Board (Graphics Project)

This branch contains a C++ project that graphically draws a full chessboard using the `graphics.h` library.

## Description:
- Uses `graphics.h` to draw an 8x8 chessboard with alternating black and white squares.
- Each square is calculated and drawn based on screen coordinates.
- Designed for learning basic graphics and layout with C++.

## Requirements:
- Code::Blocks or any C++ IDE that supports `graphics.h`.
- Proper installation and linking of the graphics library (e.g., WinBGIm).

## Features:
- Renders a static chessboard.
- Clean layout and proper use of graphics functions like `rectangle()`, `setfillstyle()`, and `bar()`.

## Files:
- `main.cpp`: Main source file for rendering the chessboard.

## Notes:
- This is a static board (no pieces or movement logic).
- Can be extended to include interactive gameplay or animations.
